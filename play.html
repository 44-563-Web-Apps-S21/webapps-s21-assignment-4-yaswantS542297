      <h2> Winter's Tale </h2>
    <h3>Act 1, Scene 1 : Antechamber in LEONTES' palace.
        <br>Enter ARCHIDAMUS, CAMILLO, and other Attendants.<br>
    </h3>
    <p><b>ARCHIDAMUS</b><br>
        If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on
        the like occasion whereon my services are now on
        foot, you shall see, as I have said, great
        difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.<br><br>
        <b>CAMILLO</b><br>
        I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia
        means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.<br><br>
        <b>ARCHIDAMUS</b><br>
        Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
        justified in our loves; for indeed--<br><br>
        <b>CAMILLO</b>
        Beseech you,--<br>
        <b>ARCHIDAMUS</b>
        Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:
        we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
        not what to say.<br>
         We will give you sleepy drinks,
        that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,
        may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse
        us.<br><br>
        <b>CAMILLO</b><br>
        You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.<br><br>
        <b>ARCHIDAMUS</b><br>
        Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me
        and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.<br><br>
        <b>CAMILLO</b><br>
        Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
        They were trained together in their childhoods; and
        there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,
        which cannot choose but branch now.<br>
        Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made
        separation of their society, their encounters,
        though not personal, have been royally attorneyed
        with interchange of gifts, letters, loving
        embassies; that they have seemed to be together,
        though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and
        embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed
        winds. The heavens continue their loves!<br><br>
        <b>ARCHIDAMUS</b><br>
        I think there is not in the world either malice or
        matter to alter it.<br>
        You have an unspeakable comfort of your young prince 
        Mamillius: it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
        into my note.<br><br>
        <b>CAMILLO</b><br>
        I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it
        is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the
        subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on
        crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
        see him a man.<br><br>
        <b>ARCHIDAMUS</b><br>
        Would they else be content to die?<br><br>
        <b>CAMILLO</b><br>
        Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should
        desire to live.<br><br>
        <b>ARCHIDAMUS</b><br>
        If the king had no son, they would desire to live
        on crutches till he had one.
